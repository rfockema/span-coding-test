# Span coding test

I used python3 for the coding test

The ./app/app.py file contains the application that accepts the stdin
The ./tests/test_app.py file contains the automated tests for the application

To run the tests pytest must be installed (pip install -U pytest). 
When it is insalled the following comamnd will run the test:
> python -m pytest
