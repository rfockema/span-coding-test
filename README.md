# Span coding test

I used python3 for the coding test

The ./app/league_table.py file contains the application that accepts the stdin.

The ./tests/test_app.py file contains the automated tests for the application.

To run the tests, pytest must be installed (pip install -U pytest). 

When pytest is installed the following command will run the tests:
> python -m pytest
